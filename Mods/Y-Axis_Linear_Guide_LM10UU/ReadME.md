# Y-Axis Linear Guide w/ LM10UU linear bearings. 
Keep in mind that these bearings can be a bit noisy, but should otherwise require minimum maintenance. 

# Hardware: 
4 pieces LM10UU linear bearings 

- 10x M3x12mm screws + 10x M3 bolts. (Mounts)
- 8x M3x25mm screws + 8x M3 bolts. (Carrier plate)
- 2x M4x8mm screws + 2x M4 bolts. Longer screws *should* work. (Carrier plate, 2 centre screws)

## Print instructions:
Completely support-free design. Should be printed in a pretty strong material but i printed it in PLA. Considering the low heat-resistance requirements this should be fine but i would still recommend printing in a generally stronger material such as ABS or ASA. 

- I Printed at .2mm layer height with a .6mm nozzle. Lower layer heights makes for stronger parts. 
- 50%+ infill
- traingular/cubic infill pattern. 
- 3 walls. 
- Higher than average print-temperature, since higher print temperatures promotes better layer adhesion and therefore overall strength. 

##  Assembly instructions: 
1. Install LM10UU to plate. To install the LM10UU bearings, heat up the **longest** sides of each insert-hole, then quickly pressfit the bearing into position. I did this with my palms. For best results, try heating the least amount. Using a hammer to *tap* it in can be beneficial. The thin lines in the insert hole aligns with the linear bearings circular cutout throughout the outer shell, eliminating sliding movement. If installed successfully, it should sit rock-solid in place. 
2. Install the Y-Axis plate to the steel bed plate. Requires 2xM4 screws and nuts in the centre, and 6xM3 screws throughout the part. 
3. Install the linear rod mounts, making sure to not tighten the screw. The mounts should be able to slide along the 2020 extrusion. Slide the linear rods in to the mounts, leaving space for the carrier plate to be installed. 
4. Install the carrier plate in to the linear rods, slide the rod through the entire plate and insert it into the other mount. 
5. Align the plate and rods, centering and taking in to account the deviation. This is best done by sliding the plate as closely as possible to the mounts, then tightening them. Be sure to center them first, though. 
6. Turn the printer to the side and install the Y-Axis clamp for the belt, putting even pressure on all 4 screws. It is best to put a piece of belt, the same length as the clamp, to the opposite side of the printers Y-Axis belt. This will increase friction and could supress other problems.
