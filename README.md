# CZ3000 - The Crazy3DPrint CZ300 On Steroids

Before i introduce this project, i would like to recommend that you read this entire page, atleast once. You will not regret it! 

This repository aims to improve the Crazy3DPrint CZ-300 for faster, better and more reliable printing. The biggest focus of this repository is bang-for-buck, meaning that all upgrades will focus on maximizing functionality for the minimum amount of $$$. Though, i try to have some aesthetic traits with my desings. Because of the money focus of this printer, many parts are high-quality clones and other parts are reused. 

**Note that this is not an officiall Crazy3DPrint repository. Any and all modifications are done at your own risk and may void your warrenty!**

## Welcome!

Hello there fellow maker, and welcome to the first community page for the Crazy3DPrint CZ-300! I hope that this page inspires many of you to experiment and get out of your comfort zone. Feel free to use, modify and personalize your CZ-300 using the resources in this repository. As a favor, though, i ask of one thing: give as much back as you can! Feel free to send in new STL:s, designs, questions, and/or other contributions. Your work is much appreciated! 

## Hesitant on whether or not you should buy this printer? 

Remember that a lot of information about the value-factor of this printer should be taken with a grain of salt. These can be subjective opinions and, at the end of the day, **it is you who must decide if you are willing to pour time and money in to unlocking the full potential of this printer.**

To put it shortly: if you are a tinkering type, this printer is probably something for you. If not, maybe a more standard and open-source printer with better community support is better suited. Although i do not aim to discourage beginners wanting to buy this printer, i would advise against it. For most people learning the basics of 3D-printing can be frustrating and it takes time, practice and troubleshooting, especially without any prior knowledge of electronics, mechanics or maybe programming. Therefore, starting on something intended for beginners is recommended. This printer simply has a lot of quirks and non-standard components. This, in combination with old software, difficult leveling and the non-existant community support can lead to great frustration down the road. If you still feel like you have the guts to take this printer on, i say go for it! But like the age old saying goes, *Don't run before you can walk!*

Some pro's and con's on this printer: 
 
\+ Super affordable and often heavily discounted (£140-£170). \
\+ Large print volume (310x320x300)mm, which is unheard of at this price-point. \
\+ Excellent extruder, even though it doesn't include the filament-runout detector board inside. \
\+ Linear rods. \
\+ The frame easily allows for a bigger bed as an upgrade path down the road. \
\+ The perfect *large-format* project printer on a low budget.


\- **Completely closed-source.** \
\- Proprietary, rare, unusual and somewhat outdated components. \
\- Replacement parts are very expensive, difficult to find and no clones are available. \
\- Stock nozzles has non-standard threads and are only sold for unreasonable prices with just brass or steel .4mm nozzles available. \
\- Heavy components, no belt tensioning and very long bowden tube equals slow stock print speeds and print materials. 


Though do keep in mind that the negatives for this printer is eliminated when modifcated, like with a new hotend or open-source motherboard. For more details on the work needed for this printer to exceed, see the documentation. Would highly recommend checking the roadmap if you are still hesitant. 

## Background

I initially planned on selling the designs and firmware for my modified CZ-300. However, after realizing how many of you fellow makers wanted a community page for this printer, i decided to make this project open-source for anyone to use. I bought my printer from 3DPrima, as they sold it for just £169 shipped. As most of us soon realized, though, this printer needs a lot of work. This is where my journey had begun. 

As of the the date this repository was created, i have spent countless of hours and dollars measuring, modeling, creating and printing parts for this printer. Most parts required multiple revisions to get them perfect, so that those with just this printer can rely on the parts fitting first try. As i've now decided to make this project open-source, i would very much appreciate any donations as a thanks. [Buy me a coffee!](https://paypal.me/navilhossain2)

## Documentation 

Under the documentation folder you will find any and all documentation and information collected about the printer. This includes the origin of parts, links to forums, manuals, roadmaps, and back-ups of any official documentation. 

***NOTE: I have plans on creating price-charts when im finished with my specific printer, so keep your eyes open for that!***

## Firmware

Under firmware you will find Marlin configuration files and back-ups of official firmware, shall their site go down. 

***NOTE: Using a dissassembler and decoding the orignal .bin file, then comparing it to the decoded DUET2 pins.h file and extracting the parameters could yield in a working pins.h file for this proprietary motherboard. Although i am not at all experianced with reverse-engineering software, i could give it a try. However, if anyone with some expertise in reverse-engineering could help it would be super beneficial and much appreciated for the progress of this printer!***

## Mods

This should be the most exciting part of this project. Here lies links to public modification as well as those made by contributers to this repository.
